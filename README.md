Identify consumers that prefer filling in a lead form vs calling in, in order to optimize which media channel to use when advertising in the USA.


DELIVERABLES:
Target Objective:
To classify the consumers that prefer filling in a ‘lead form’ vs ‘calling’ in  order to make the best decision on which media channel to use when advertising in the USA.

Stretch Goal:
Should there be additional time, the data should be further analysed to determine whether a particular media channel is more strongly associated with sales/activations. Further research investigating whether there are any trends related to certain media channels and specific providers/products could also be of value.

Persevere or Pivot:
Agree on a check-in date
At check-in : Is it a viable project?

Problem Statement:

One line problem statement:
To classify the consumers that prefer filling in a ‘lead form’ vs ‘calling’ in  order to make the best decision on which media channel to use when advertising in the USA.

Objectives:
To classify which consumers prefer which channel based on the given data.
Project Milestones:
Data Cleaning
EDA (surface insights)
Model Building trials
Test supervised models
Test unsupervised models

Model Tests on new data

Proposed approach:
The company has the following Lead data:
The company has data of customers who either called in or filled in a lead form to indicate interest on a product.
For customers who continued with a purchase, the item number (single,double or triple play) and location data (zip code) was captured. 
For customers who made a purchase and cancelled the sale the location data was then deleted from the database (only item number remains)
The database also shows which customers went on to activate packages after the was made.
Desired Outcome:
Confidently predict which leads (lead form/website) will maximise revenue for a given area based on past data.



Equation of Value:

Models
What is the status quo?
What was tried and failed in the past?
Are we considering distributed computing?
Gaussian process / NLP / Neural Nets / … ?
How & when do we create / update models?
How do we build features out of the raw data?
How long does featurising take?
What does the pipeline look like?



Measure / Evaluate
What does success look like?
How do we evaluate the business value?
How do we know that we’re solving the problem?
Accuracy / robustness measures and frequency of use
What is the current process and current accuracy / robustness “score” 
How long should it take to evaluate a new input?
